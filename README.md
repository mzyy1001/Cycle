# Cycle: A Mood-Responsive Productivity App

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Cycle** is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between productivity and mental well-being. Unlike rigid task management tools, Cycle adapts your daily schedule based on your current emotional state—helping you stay productive without burning out.

## 📚 Context and Knowledge Base

Our project addresses the rising issue of emotional fatigue and toxic productivity among students and young professionals, especially in a post-pandemic world. Many digital tools optimize for output but fail to consider the user’s mental health.

We bring interdisciplinary expertise in **computer science**, **psychology**, and **UX design**, alongside personal experiences navigating emotional ups and downs while managing deadlines. We also have access to:

- University mental health forums
- Peer productivity communities
- Early user testers for concept validation

## 👥 Target Users and Stakeholders

### 🎯 Primary Users

- **University students** dealing with stress, burnout, and deadline fatigue.
- **Young professionals**, especially in remote/hybrid roles, struggling with unstructured workdays.
- **Neurodivergent individuals** (e.g., ADHD) seeking tools for emotional regulation and routine.

### 🤝 Stakeholders

- Mental health advocates & university counsellors  
- Productivity coaches  
- Existing users of tools like Notion, Todoist, Headspace

### 📌 Example Personas

- **Ella**, 21: Final-year student, overwhelmed by coursework and anxiety. Uses to-do lists but feels guilty when off track.
- **Tom**, 26: Remote developer. Productivity collapses under emotional stress, leading to deadline anxiety.

## 🔍 User Research & Evidence

We conducted:

- **Informal interviews** with 5 students and 3 professionals  
- **Mood journaling trials** to observe productivity patterns  

> Key feedback:
> - “I push through even when I feel terrible, then crash and waste an entire day.”
> - “I never know how to pace my day when I wake up anxious.”
> - “Some apps make me feel worse when I miss tasks.”

## 💡 Insight & Analysis

Our core insight:  
> Emotional state **directly impacts** productivity rhythm, yet most tools treat all days equally.

Users want **structure with empathy**, not pressure.

### 🔑 Design Imperatives

1. Normalize mood check-ins—no guilt.
2. Adapt tasks and schedule to reduce overload.
3. Build long-term consistency over short-term hustle.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Most productivity apps ignore emotional well-being. This leads to burnout and negative self-perception when users can't meet rigid goals.

## 🌱 Opportunity Statement

**How might we** design a **mood-aware productivity app** that supports mental health while still encouraging meaningful progress?

## 📱 Initial Product Concept

- **Daily mood check-in** to guide planning
- **Adaptive to-do list** that scales workload to mental energy
- **Smart scheduling** to reduce decision fatigue on low-energy days
