def call_gpt_rescheduler(tasks, now_iso):

You are a smart personal task scheduler.

The current time is: {now_iso}, please allocate tasks for today after this time.

Here is a list of today's tasks in JSON format. Each task contains:
- id: task ID
- task: task name
- mood: user's mood (e.g., "Focused", "Tired", "Creative")
- timestamp: current timestamp (you may ignore this)
- length: task length in minutes

Your job is to reschedule all tasks **within today**, between **09:00 and 18:00**, satisfying the following rules:

1. The tasks must not overlap.
2. Each task should be scheduled for its specified `length` duration.
3. Tasks with mood "Focused" should be scheduled earlier in the day.
4. Tasks with mood "Tired" should be scheduled later in the day.
5. Try to place short breaks (5-10 minutes) between tasks if time allows.
6. Keep all tasks within the time range of {now_iso} to 24:00.
Here is the task list:

{json.dumps(tasks, indent=2)}

Return only a JSON array where each object contains:
- id: the task ID
- timestamp: a new ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., "2025-06-11T09:30:00")

Do not return any explanation, commentary, or markdown formatting â€” just the raw JSON.
