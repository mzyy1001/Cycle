## ðŸ§¾ Legal Considerations

The Cycle project uses a mix of open-source and proprietary technologies. All third-party libraries (React Native, Express, SQLite, etc.) are governed by open licenses like MIT or Public Domain, and have been listed with links to their sources and licenses.

We also use OpenAIâ€™s GPT API for generating dynamic task rescheduling and visual content. According to OpenAIâ€™s terms, content generated via API belongs to the user, provided it complies with the [Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies). If the project is to be publicly deployed or monetized, further steps must be taken to ensure:

- Compliance with OpenAI's commercial use terms and API quotas;
- Attribution and rights management of GPT-generated media if required;
- User data protection in line with regulations such as GDPR or UK Data Protection Act;
- Ensuring that any AI decisions affecting users are explainable and non-discriminatory.

These points should be carefully reviewed by a future development or legal team before public launch.
