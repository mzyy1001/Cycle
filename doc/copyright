## Legal Considerations for Official Release

- **OpenAI-Generated Content**  
  As per OpenAIâ€™s terms of service, the generated content belongs to the user, provided it complies with their usage policy. No specific attribution is required unless redistribution of model outputs violates policies or includes sensitive content.

- **GDPR & UK Data Protection Compliance**  
  The app stores and manipulates user-authored tasks, which may qualify as personal data. Before public release:
  - Obtain explicit **user consent**;
  - Provide a clear **Privacy Policy**;
  - Minimize and secure data storage;
  - Ensure AI decisions are explainable and non-discriminatory.

- **Attribution Requirements**  
  While most open-source components (MIT, Public Domain, PSF) do not require attribution, including a license and credits section is best practice. OpenAI outputs should include disclaimers or usage clarifications where applicable.

- **OpenAI API Limits**  
  Confirm compliance with OpenAIâ€™s quotas, rate limits, and commercial use policies when deploying beyond free tiers.

- **Future Licensing**  
  Consider including a project-wide license (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0) and providing a `NOTICE` or `LICENSE` file detailing third-party libraries and their associated licenses.
